                    This sentence has five words. <a href="#">Here</a> are five
                    more words. Five-word sentences are fine.
                    <a href="#">But</a> several together become monotonous.
                    Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <a href="#">sound</a> of it drones. It’s like a stuck
                    record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the
                    sentence length, and I create music. Music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a
                    harmony. I use short sentences. And <a href="#">I</a> use
                    sentences of medium length.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I
                    will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a
                    sentence that burns with
                    <a href="#">energy</a> and builds with all the impetus of a
                    crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the
                    cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.
